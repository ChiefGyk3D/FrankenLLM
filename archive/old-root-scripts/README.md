# Archived Root Scripts

These scripts were older versions that have been replaced by improved versions in `bin/`, `local/`, and `remote/` directories.

## Replacements

| Old Root Script | Current Replacement |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `check-gpus.sh` | `bin/check-gpus.sh` |
| `health-check.sh` | `bin/health-check.sh` |
| `pull-model.sh` | `bin/pull-model.sh` |
| `pull-dual-models.sh` | `bin/pull-dual-models.sh` |
| `test-llm.sh` | `bin/test-llm.sh` |
| `list-models.sh` | Functionality in other tools |
| `remote-install.sh` | `remote/install.sh` |
| `start-services.sh` | `./manage.sh start` |
| `manage-services.sh` | `./manage.sh` |

## Why Archived

These scripts were kept for reference but have been superseded by:
- Better error handling
- More features
- Consistent directory structure
- Improved documentation

Use the current versions in `bin/`, `local/`, or `remote/` directories instead.
